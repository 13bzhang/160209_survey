<ul><li>Recently there was a collision between an American and a Chinese military plane. The collision occurred because the Chinese plane was flying dangerous maneuvers around the American plane, making several close passes. On the third pass, the Chinese plane collided with the American plane. The American pilot died. The Chinese pilot just barely managed to eject and survive. Both planes were destroyed.</li></ul>
